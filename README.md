# Music-Playlist-Analyzer
The project is a music data analysis tool that loads a set of music data and provides functionality 
to filter and analyze the data. The data is stored in a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary 
representing a single song and containing fields such as the artist, title, genre, year, and duration.
Requirements:
* The project must have a function to convert the song durations from seconds to minutes and seconds.
* The project must have a function to filter the music data based on a specific genre and/or year.
* The project must have a function to analyze the music data by computing the average song duration for each artist.
* The project must output the filtered and analyzed data to the console.
* The project must use proper function and variable naming conventions to make the code easy to read and understand.
* The project must be well-documented using docstrings and comments to explain each function's purpose and inputs/outputs.
* The project must be modular, with each function performing a specific task and not exceeding a few dozen lines of code. This will help with maintainability and readability.
* The project should handle potential errors such as incorrect or missing input data, file loading errors, and other runtime errors that could occur.
* The project must be well-tested to ensure that each function produces the expected results and handles potential errors as expected.
